i WOULD HAVE TO PAY RENT WICH WOULD TAKE AWAY AROUND $500, SO THEN THATR WOULD LEAVE ME WITH AROUD $600. i would then spend that money on food when i need to. i would try to buy food that is cheaper and in bulk that is also in larg portions and lasts a for a while. I would also try to save as much money as i can so that if there is another emergency.
