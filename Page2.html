            What is COVID-19
        </p>

<p>
COVID-19 is a virus is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.
        <P>
            <p>
            COVID-19 is not caused by the same coronavirus that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. However, it is in the same family of viruses.
            </p>
            <p>
                People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic or the sickes.
            </p>
            <p>
Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms or when they are asymptomati. There have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
            </p>
                
        </P> 
        <p>
           The disease causes respiratory illness like the flu with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. 


        <p>
    Older people and people of any age with underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, lung disease, or heart disease, are at greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals and humans. This type coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is a newly discovered coronavirus that has not been previously detected in animals or humans.
        <p>
            <p>
            Because this is a new virus, there are still things we do not know, such as how severe the illness can be, how well it is transmitted between people, and other features of the virus.    
        </p>
    Typically, human coronaviruses cause mild-to-moderate respiratory illness. Symptoms are very similar to the flu, including:
 </p> </p>
--Fever-- 
    </p> </p>
--Cough--
</p> </p>
--Shortness of breath--
</p> </p>
--COVID-19 can cause more severe respiratory illness.--
        </p>
<p> These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.</p>
