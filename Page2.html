I would have to spend some money on rent which would set me back around $500 which would then leave me with around $700. I would then spend that money on food when i need to. I would try to buy food that is cheaper and in bulk that is also in larg portions and lasts a for a while. I would also try to save as much money as i can so that if there is another emergency.
