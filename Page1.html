          A major thing that has highlighted my year is videogames. Since I have a lot of time on my hands I play more videogames, a video gme that I have been playing a lot of is Destiny 2 and more recently is Tekken 7. I like to play tekken 7 with my brothers and friends have these game as well so we spend most of our time playing with each other and sometimes against each other. Another game that has also been fun playing with my little brothers is Assassins Creed, when we beat one game we go and try to beat the next one after that, trying to beat all the Assassins Creed games in order.
