          A form of media that really impacted me are shows on television like the Dragon Ball franchise. Throughout my childhood
          I grew up watching Dragon Ball on television and also playing Dragon Ball games on the Playstation 3 with my brothers 
          and my friends, and I still do today. Dragon Ball has entroduced and has enstilled good moral in me, like to work hard, 
          and that there is no shame in pursuing paths different to the ones your friends pursue. Dragon Ballhas helped me make 
          deeper bonds with my brothers and my friends and also introduced me to the world of Anime and the Japanese language.
